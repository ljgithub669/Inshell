 # Welocme to Inshell
 
 ## What's Inshell?
 *Inshell is a shell script that can change software source and install the necessary software once for linux.*

**Why you wrote this script?**
 
     Because I usually reinstall my linux system,
     I have to repeatedly configure the system environment and install the same software.

## Environment
    Ubuntu 18.04

    Other linux system is also avaliable, just a few modifications

## Getting Started

1. Download inshell.sh

        $ git clone https://github.com/ljgithub669/Inshell.git

2. Running it

        $ bash inshell.sh
